# FlutterApp
## Welcome to the pushNotifications wiki!
## Sending Push Notifications to a Virtual Machine using Flutter

Firstly, the UI is designed to show what we have received as a notification, and a counter is designed to see how many notifications we get. Also, three states may occur when a device receives notifications. States are while app is running, app is in background and while app is terminated by the user.


In first state, when the device receives a notification while app is running it looks like this;

In second state, while app is working in background you got a notification which appears on your notifications tab.

In third state, when app is terminated by the user we have similar push notification as app in background.
